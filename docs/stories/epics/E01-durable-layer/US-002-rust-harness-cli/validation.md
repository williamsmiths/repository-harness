# Validation

## Proof Strategy

Prove parity before replacement. Each migrated command should be tested against
a temporary SQLite database and compared to the current command contract.

The Bash CLI can remain as a reference implementation until the Rust CLI proves
the same durable-layer behavior.

## Test Plan

| Layer | Cases |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Parse command flags into typed values; reject invalid lanes, statuses, booleans, and missing required flags. |
| Integration | Create a temp database, apply schema, run migrated use cases, and verify rows with SQLite queries. |
| E2E | Install Harness into a temp target, download or locate the prebuilt CLI, run `scripts/harness init`, `intake`, `query intakes`, and `trace`. |
| Platform | Verify supported macOS and Linux binary selection, checksum validation, and clear unsupported-platform errors. |
| Performance | Query commands should remain fast on small local databases; no benchmark gate until larger trace volumes exist. |
| Logs/Audit | Trace writes remain available through `scripts/harness trace` and `scripts/harness query traces`. |

## Fixtures

- Temporary target project with no existing Harness files.
- Temporary target project with existing Harness files for merge behavior.
- Temporary SQLite database seeded with `scripts/schema/001-init.sql`.
- Release-artifact fixture or local file server for installer download tests.

## Acceptance Evidence

- `cargo fmt --check`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace`: passed, 9 tests.
- `bash -n scripts/harness scripts/install-harness.sh`: passed.
- `.github/workflows/harness-cli-release.yml`: added to verify the workspace,
  build the four supported CLI release targets on hosted native runners, and
  publish `harness-cli-<platform>` plus `.sha256` assets to the GitHub Release
  for `v*` or `harness-cli-v*` tags.
- `scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`: passed and wrote
  `dist/harness-cli-macos-arm64` plus checksum.
- Temporary database smoke passed through the Rust delegated command paths:
  `init`, `migrate`, `import brownfield`, `intake`, `story add`, `story
  update`, `decision add`, `decision verify`, `backlog add`, `backlog close`,
  `trace`, `query matrix`, `query backlog`, `query decisions`, `query
  intakes`, `query traces`, `query friction`, `query stats`, and `query sql`.
- Brownfield import fixture test passed: existing Harness v0 markdown seeded a
  story from `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`, a decision from `docs/decisions/`, and
  multiple backlog items from `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`; rerunning the importer
  did not duplicate backlog rows.
- Installer E2E passed using the local `dist` release source. It downloaded
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli`, verified the checksum, ran `scripts/harness init`,
  recorded an intake, and queried stats without relying on a local Cargo build
  inside the target project.
- Checksum failure test passed: a corrupt `.sha256` file caused the installer
  to stop before accepting the binary.
- `--skip-cli-download` test passed: installer skipped the binary and
  `scripts/harness init` still worked through Bash fallback.
- Existing `.gitignore` merge test passed: custom rules were preserved while
  `harness.db` and `scripts/bin/harness-cli` ignore rules were appended.

Remaining evidence needed before story completion:

- Run the release workflow from a real tag and confirm the GitHub Release
  contains all eight expected assets for the four supported targets.
